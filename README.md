launcher
========

The `launcher` binary is used to combine multiple benchmark binaries into a single executable file that can be used by ESESC.

This repository is intended to include the `main` function for the launcher along with source code for open source benchmarks (PARSEC and SPLASH).  Also the diff files needed for closed source benchmarks (CPU 2000 & 2006) will be included.  Also the Makefiles needed to compile everything will be included.

Currently only the `main` function and one `Makefile` are included in the repository.
